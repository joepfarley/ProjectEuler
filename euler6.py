The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten 
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
 hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
 
 Let's define the steps
 
 easy stuff
	Create list 
	put in variable 
	sum up list 
	square it
 
 hard stuff
	square all the numbers between 1 and 100
	add them together
